        <p>
          Welcome to the McMaster Digital Transformation Research Centre
          (MDTRC), where we make sense of the digital transformation that is
          affecting everything we do in our professional, educational, and
          personal lives. At this innovative facility, we leverage neuroscience
          tools and techniques to provide us with an understanding of how the
          use of technology impacts us. We gain a deep understanding of the user
          experience through the traditional and neurophysiological data we
          collect. Our goal is to expand knowledge of digital transformation
          opportunities and challenges to allow researchers to create rich and
          meaningful user experiences. We hope to collaborate with you soon.
